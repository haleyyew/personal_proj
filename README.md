These are all my personal projects:

Eulers Method Calculator
------------------------

Eulers Method Calculator calculates differential equations of the form y' + n*y = 0, where n is a number. Note that no other form works. The project was implemented using python, and with the built-in GUI package Tkinter. Details about how this calculator was implemented are inside the file euler_method_diff_eqn.py. 
This calculator can be run using a python 2.7 interpreter. The __main__ .py file is called application_window_oop.py, open it and run it. 
Or the calculator can be run directly by clicking the application_window_oop.exe inside the dist folder.
The executable files are also available for download on my personal project Google Drive public folder:
